# Enterprise-Document-Management-System
In todayâ€™s industry, there is a dire need of reducing paper trails of important documents.
Management of documents for external and internal audit is a challenge in an enterprise.
Although there are major products in the market that provide efficient document management tools and extensions, it is not possible for small users/business groups to afford such services.
Another issue that users experience is service denials. 
Hence, a cloud based document management system is built for handling audits.

Following are the features of the web-based application:
(i) Management of Users
(ii) Document Upload
(iii) Document Approval
(iv) Document Download
(v) Email Notification Service
